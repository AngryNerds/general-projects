            From: Agent X.<br />
            To: Dr. J. Smith, Ph.D.
            </p>
            <p>
            Fiften days ago, the US Government began to receive a strange pattern of recurring 
            low alpha frequency burts, unlike anything we'd ever seen before. We tracked the frequency 
            back to its point of origin, and found a guava.<br />
            </p>
            <p>
            Yes, a guava. The fruit.
            </p>
            <p>
            As you can imagine, we were quite perplexed, so we took the guava in for analysis. We 
            had some of our top scientists examine it, and came up with nothing. However, two days ago, 
            a young quantum physicist had the idea of observing its quantum wave function. We were all shocked to see his
            findings: a recurring, non-intrinsic anomaly distribution. Being a quantum physicist yourself, 
            you must realize the shocking implications of the aforementioned observation:
            </p>
            <p>
            We have discovered a time-traveling guava.
            </p>
            <p>
            We have no idea where it came from, or why anyone would give a guava time-traveling abilities, 
            but we decided to take advantage of this incredible stroke of luck.
            </p>
            <p>
            You see, any sort of time-traveling entity would have an enormous amount of temporal energy, the 
            unbridled power of which, if harnessed correctly, could provide the world with way too much energy. 
            We decided to fund a top secret project, codenamed "Really Valuable Fruit," in attempt to find some
            method of channeling the guava's near infinite temporal energy.
            </p>
            <p>
            However, after pouring 16.3 billion dollars into the project, we ended up where we began: with 
            absolutely nothing. This is where you come in.
            </p>
            <p>
            You see, we are aware that you are one of the top scientists in the world, perhaps the only one who 
            has any chance of controlling the guava's enormous potential. We request your assistance in doing so, 
            and strongly advise your utmost obedience, or we shall be forced to increase your annual income tax 
            rate by 6.7%.
            </p>
            <p>
            We look forward to having you with us, or to thinking of various, trivial ways to torment you in your 
            daily life, a pursuit which brings us great enjoyment.
            </p>
